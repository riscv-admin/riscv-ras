# RAS Charter

 

## Scope

In order to promote development of RISC-V in server and embedded domain, the RAS(Reliability, Availability and Serviceability) Horizontal Subcommittee will define a RAS specification to support design of RAS features in SoC, firmware and OS.

 

## Goals

 

* RISC-V RAS Specification

** RAS terminology interpretation:

*** What is RAS

*** Types of error

*** Process of RAS

 

** RAS framework design

*** Error recording: Standard error record formats (e.g. register banks, APEI)

*** Error reporting: Error event reporting methods (e.g. exceptions, NMI,  local/global interrupts)

*** Error recovery: strategies adopted to handle the error (e.g. neglect/warning/recover/isolation/halt)

 

** RAS feature support, for example:

*** E2E Data protection

*** Error isolation

*** Data poisoning containment

*** Advanced error reporting for PCIe

 

* RAS framework design verification
