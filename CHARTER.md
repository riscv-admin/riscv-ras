# RISC-V RAS SIG Charter 

The objective of the RAS SIG is to identify both HW and SW high priority gaps within the RISC-V architecture relating to RAS (Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability) in all segments of the RISC-V ecosystem. In conducting that work, it is expected that the RAS SIG will spin up TGs to prescribe both HW and SW interfaces/conventions that solutions can be built upon. Likewise, a TG is expected to be formed to specify common terminology that the associated RAS specifications can leverage so that they are all using common language and concepts. It is anticipated that the RAS SIG, under the SoC infra HC, will work closely with other SIGs, TGs, and HCs to ensure the needs of the various groups are met. The work of the TGs will likely include both ISA and non-ISA architectural specifications and definitions depending on where the RISC-V RAS community would like to see improvements and commonality driven.
